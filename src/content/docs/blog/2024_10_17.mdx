Today, I tackled e2e tests in Java using Selenide. 
With no automation engineer on the project anymore, I decided to try maintaining 
the existing tests myself. 

It was something new for me, but it turned out to be easier than I expected. A bit of documentation, 
a few test runs â€” and the results are in! 

I plan to dive deeper into it soon and maybe even write some new tests. ;)
