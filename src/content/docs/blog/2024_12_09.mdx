In a set of katas for exploring patterns, there's one about HOCs:
[truncate paragraph with HOC in React](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a667bf8e6be382ecd000102).
Recently, I’ve also been diving into the Decorator Pattern,
and in React, an HOC could be considered an example of a Decorator.


**But is the HOC still a thing?**


I often come across HOCs in codebases that are 3–4 years old (or older),but I rarely see them in new projects.
In the old React documentation, there was even a [dedicated page about HOCs](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html), complete with examples.
But in the shiny new React documentation, HOCs are nowhere to be found.

It seems like custom hooks have taken over this territory and mostly replaced HOCs.
What can you do with an HOC that you can’t achieve with a custom hook?

**Personally, I prefer custom hooks—or even classes with their own logic**. It is more obvious
and clear for me.
