My American colleague recently asked me for recommendations on how to self-study Russian. I reached out to a friend of mine who teaches Russian as a foreign language professionally in Taipei, and now I’m happy to share a list of useful resources:

## Free resources

### Textbooks 

- A free textbook many learners recommend: https://mezhdunami.org
- “Голоса / Golosa” — very popular one:
https://oer.cercll.arizona.edu/llccommons/by-textbook/golosa-1/

Also here you can find a collection of free tools and materials https://gratisglobal.com/learn-russian-free/#news-media, 
but this list wasn't tested personally by me, my friend or her colleagues. But there is definetely a lot of interesting and useful things. 

### Apps 
- Babbel+ is surprisingly good for Russian.

### Youtube 
- https://www.youtube.com/@Russian-stories - slow and clear listening practice (super helpful!) 

- https://www.youtube.com/@russianpod101 - lots of beginner-friendly content and explanations:
