<Aside title={'TLDR'}>
    If you have SVG with defined width on it, for using as background you either need to
    set `background-size: 100% 150px` (second value is a height, put there what works for you) or `background-size: auto 150px` +
    `background-repeat: repeat-x;`

    [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/jg9mzv) with examples how SVGs look with different css options.
</Aside>

We have a background SVG at the top of our website: it is SVG image on top,
but the main part is just a gray background.

We use the following css for that:
```css
.container {
    background-image: url(path/to/our.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 100% 144px;
}
```
It works fine, but holidays are coming and our designer suggested to use a more festive background
(and of course add little snow, but there was no problem with snow). Additionally designer requested
not to stretch holiday image, so I came up with the following css

```css
.container {
    background-image: url(path/to/holiday.svg);
    background: no-repeat;
    background-size: auto 144px;
    background-position: left top;
}
```

It went to testing, then to production, and a couple of days after I have message from colleague: hey,
could we do something with holiday background on wide screens?
It was a disaster: on wide screens (more than 2500px) our background ends on 2000px and the rest is left
as an empty gray space!

Fix is really simple:
```css {3}
.container {
    background-image: url(path/to/holiday.svg);
    background: repeat-x;
    background-size: auto 144px;
    background-position: left top;
}
```
Just note: 100% or repeat.
