Every year I start solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

Okay, I was sure that I did it every year, but it looks like I only did it in 2021 and 2022 —
 and after that I took a break. It seems like moving to a new country, changing jobs, and emigrating can change your memory or perspective.

But nevertheless — I started to solve it this year again. And great part about it that I not only 
have a awesome time, trying to solve problems and tickling my brain, but also I learn new things. 

Discoveries at this moment:
- The technique (or pattern, or special data structure) of a **monotonic stack** for solving problems. 
Basically, it’s a stack (obviously) whose elements are always increasing or always decreasing. 
I liked the explanation from [here]((https://liuzhenglaichn.gitbook.io/algorithm/monotonic-stack)) (clear example + list of related LeetCode problems) 
and [here]((https://algo.monster/problems/mono_stack_intro)) (interactive example of building a monotonic stack + when to apply it). 
I needed it for the Day 3 Part 2 problem, where I had to define the biggest possible number that I could construct from a sequence of numbers.

- **[`structuredClone`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/structuredClone)** method for creating deep clones of values in JS — very handy with arrays and objects. I almost wrote the familiar `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arr))`, 
but stopped for a moment and searched. I remembered that there is a newer API I can use. 
Powerful, but with some limitations (as everything good in this world): for example, functions and DOM nodes cannot be cloned with structuredClone. 
You can find some details about the algorithm on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).
