I just listened to an [episode of The Pragmatic Engineer podcast with Laura Tacho, CTO at DX](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-the-impact-of-ai-on-software) - it’s a great conversation that I recommend to anyone in the industry. 

It advocates for something I truly believe in: measure before making conclusions. But the part that resonated with me the most that probably in 2 years, every developer will operate like a team lead — managing a team of AI agents.
So if you're not aiming to become a lead, you might still need to think like one. Now is a good time to start sharpening your technical depth, code review skills and coordination abilities (actually there's never a bad time for this). 

P.S. And they also shared a great use case for AI: code migrations. Like unit tests, migrations are something most developers don’t enjoy (I believe) — but here AI can really make a difference.
