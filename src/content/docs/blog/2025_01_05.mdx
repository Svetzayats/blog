Do you often run into memory leak problems? I don’t, but this topic is fascinating to me.
Every time I try to dig into problems with memory (sometimes out of pure curiosity),
I find these issues very hard to debug and quite stimulating for a developer's brain.

I’m not an expert in memory leaks, so I started gathering useful materials and examples.

Check out [Memory Leaks](/dev_guides/memory_leaks/) in the guide section — it’s a curated collection of links about
how garbage collection (GC) works, how to use DevTools efficiently,
and in the future, I plan to add some practical advice.
