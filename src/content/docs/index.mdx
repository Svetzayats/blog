<Card title="Let's Get Linked" icon="linkedin">
  I’m a **frontend developer** with a passion for creating effective UI solutions. My current stack includes **React** and 
  **TypeScript**, but I’m always open to learning new things and trying out new technologies. I also mentor a JavaScript 
  course at RSSchool and I'm preparing to speak at a tech conference.
