title: Memory leaks
---
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In my experience, I have run into fixing memory leaks a couple of times, and each time it was very difficult.
Task manager in browser, Memory in Performance tab, and the Memory tab are great tools accessible to us,
but using them requires a skill (and sometimes luck). I plan to dive into the topic of memory leaks:
how to understand that we have problems; how to find the source of the leak and why leaks can happen, and with
that knowledge, we can prevent them.

<Aside type={'caution'} title={'Work in progress'}>
    Note: the guide is being created as I delve into the materials.
    For now, it is more of a sketch or a draft.

### How Garbage Collector works and what about V8
- [Grokking V8 closures for fun (and profit?) by Vyacheslav Egorov (2012-14)](https://mrale.ph/blog/2012/09/23/grokking-v8-closures-for-fun.html) ‚Äî
how V8 works with closures and its performance. Low-level details about implementation, cool schemes. Key takeaways:
    - V8 creates context while entering function, not when the closure is created
    - When functions are nested, contexts can reference each other and form references chains

the author explains why they decided to rewrite CodeMirror from using a single large closure to store everything to
using objects with separated functionality. Article  [Grokking V8 closures for fun (and profit?) by Vyacheslav Egorov (2012-14)](https://mrale.ph/blog/2012/09/23/grokking-v8-closures-for-fun.html), by

- [A surprising JavaScript memory leak found at Meteor by David Glasser (2013)](https://point.davidglasser.net/2013/06/27/surprising-javascript-memory-leak.html) ‚Äî
a great investigation into a real memory leak in a Meteor app with an example of fix. The issue was related to
closures and a large object in memory that was not cleared by the Garbage Collector, even though it was no longer in use.
- [Garbage collection and closures by Jake Archibald (2024)](https://jakearchibald.com/2024/garbage-collection-and-closures/) ‚Äî
another example of a memory leak caused by closures: how closures can prevent the Garbage Collector
from clearing unnecessary objects from memory.
As a bonus, links to browser bug reports addressing this behavior.

- [Sneaky React Memory Leaks: How `useCallback` and closures can bite you by Kevin Schiener (2024)](https://www.schiener.io/2024-03-03/react-closures) ‚Äî
in our React code, there are plenty of closures (even if we don't realize it) and in most cases, everything works fine.
But when we use `useCallback` to store a reference to a function and avoid its re-creation between renders ‚Äî there could be
some issues. Kevin gives a detailed explanation what happens and shares some recommendations.
- [Sneaky React Memory Leaks II: Closures Vs. React Query by Kevin Schiener (2024)](https://www.schiener.io/2024-05-29/react-query-leaks) ‚Äî
another example showing how a memory leak can occur, this time using React Query. The recommendation is to simply extract everything related
to `useQuery` into a custom hook, because each hook creates its own context for closures.

React Compiler solves part of the problems for us with closures and memory leaks, but problems can still arise
‚Äî Kevin highlights the issues and suggest using `bind` to prevent them.
