Overall, I expected a deeper dive and more explanations, 
but the approach itself is quite interesting: 
we build a mini-framework while discussing how tests should work, 
what they should show, and what to focus on.

This is truly about the **fundamentals — and nothing more**.

### Key takeaways

- A test should capture the intention we're trying to solve with the code.

- We don't write tests to pass; we write them to fail. 
This is about TDD and ensuring we get notified when the code no longer aligns 
with the original intention.

- Tests document the code.

- Tests should be written carefully, as we and our colleagues will be 
the ones reading them later.

- Unreliable tests are meaningless.

### EpicWeb platform — my respect 
What really impressed me was the workshop platform. 
If you just watch the video on the site, it prompts you with a reminder 
that this is not a video course but a workshop. 
It directs you to clone the repo, run the platform, and work within it. 

Essentially, you run the app locally, watch videos, read materials, 
and sync your tasks with a local editor based on your progress. It’s really awesome!
