title: "Podlodka TechLead Crew #7"
---

During the week of October 14 to 18, I was happy to be a part of Podlodka Techlead Crew #7.
I watched talks and interviews in the mornings and evenings (some I still need to catch up on via recordings, as I couldn’t attend all of them live) and even participated in the architecture kata.
I realized how much more I still want to learn :)

### Key takeaways

- Not all systems require absolute reliability or a disaster recovery plan.
It’s important to find a balance and understand what’s really critical and what’s not.
Also, consider how much the business is willing to invest in this.

- Avoid over-engineering during the design phase.
It’s better to improve, modify, and refactor along the way.

- Test coverage and documentation from the very beginning are essential for ensuring reliability.

- Feature toggles are great, but you need to keep an eye on their number.

- Understanding real business processes is critical when designing systems.


### My top-3 talks

1. Disaster Recovery Interview - Daniil Podolsky (Yadro)
2. Monsters Under the Bed - Alexey Uzhva
3. Canary Deployment: From Strategy to Reliability - Ilya Sadykov (Avito)
