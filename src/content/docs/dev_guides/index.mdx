I’ve noticed that sometimes I end up solving the same problem twice. 
But that’s not the real issue. 
The real issue is that I often forget how I solved it the first time. 
That’s why I decided to start writing down guides for myself.

Just a heads-up: I may document very simple things, and I’m not claiming to be an expert in the field.

I simply want to share my experiences and help myself (and maybe others) save time.

P.S. I’m aiming to shift my approach to something more automated—like writing a script if I need to solve the same problem twice. But for now, I’ll focus on writing guides.
