  <Card title="About Development" icon="star">
    I specialize in React/TS/JS and am always open to learning new things and trying out new technologies. Since I don’t fully rely on my memory, 
    I’ve started writing dev notes — collections of resources that I find interesting, along with insights and guides.

  <Card title="About Reading" icon="star">
    I love reading books, especially fantasy and non-fiction. Sometimes, I share
     my thoughts in reviews and keep a reading diary to track my journey.

### Me as a Developer
My current stack includes React, TypeScript, and JavaScript. In my free time, I’m also learning Vue, Svelte, and Remix. I’m particularly impressed by the Remix framework and can’t wait to use it in my projects. Svelte feels like magic to me at the moment, and I plan to dive deeper into it and eventually use it on this website.

At work, I’m a frontend engineer responsible for three projects:
- A platform for managing office space and resources
- A platform for automating onboarding processes
- An internal platform for managing company location data

### My current goals
- Complete my personal website (this one) 
- Achieve a strong English B2 and Georgian A1 proficiency
- Develop a system for storing and sharing my knowledge
- Finish the course [The Hard Parts of Asynchronous JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-new-hard-parts/)
- Maintain regular sports activities
