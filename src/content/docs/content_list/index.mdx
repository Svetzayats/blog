## What is that 
A long time ago at school I was taught to keep a reading diary: 
to write down the title of the book, the author, the date of reading, and my thoughts about it.
I was cheating: I was copying the thoughts from summary in the back of the book.

I liked the idea of a reading diary. 

And recently I decided to start keeping it again - online. 

It is just information when I read the book, sometimes what I think about it and some quotes. 
And also I want to keep impressions about movies, series, and other content I consume.

## What for 
I am not a machine with a perfect memory. I forget things. 
But I want to remember what I read, what I thought about it, what I liked and what I didn't.
