## Summary 
_The Unbearable Lightness of Being_ is a philosophical novel by Milan Kundera. 
It explores themes of love, emigration, and philosophical ideas as they relate to the lives of the characters. 
You’ll also come across a peculiar take on the death of Stalin’s son.
## My thoughts
I fell in love with this book from the beginning, 
but my opinion shifted after I reached the last third. Still, it was a good read overall.

I really enjoyed the language (I read the Russian translation), and I was 
struck by how similar people’s problems and thoughts from that time are to those we have today. 
For example, the discussion about whether Czech people should fight against the Soviet Union — 
if you swap a few words, it could easily apply to a book about current events.

The characters didn’t impress me much, but the women were more interesting.

The book is full of memorable phrases and thoughts, making it a great source for quotes.

**Note**: The Russian version of this review will differ and include some citations.
